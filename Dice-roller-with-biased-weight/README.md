# Biased Dice Roller  

This is a Python script that simulates rolling **biased dice**, where certain numbers appear more frequently than others.

## Features  
 Generates two **biased** random dice values (1-6).  
 Uses **weighted probability** to favor specific numbers.  
 Allows the user to roll again or exit.  

## How It Works  
The script uses Pythonâ€™s `random.choices()` function with a **weight distribution** to control how often each number appears.  



ðŸ’¡  Modify the `weights` list in `dice_biased.py` to change the probability of each number.
